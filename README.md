# LSTM Flow Prediction

## Description
This repository contains a project for flow prediction using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network model. The project focuses on time series analysis using precipitation data from 9 different stations to predict flow rates. This model can be particularly useful for applications in hydrology and water resource management.

## Installation
Instructions to set up the necessary environment to run the project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cassianodescovi/7sss.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd 7sss
# Install the dependencies (assuming you have Python and pip installed)
pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
To run the `LSTM_flow_prediction.ipynb` notebook:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook on your machine or use a development environment that supports Jupyter Notebooks.
2. Navigate to the directory where the project was cloned.
3. Open the file `LSTM_flow_prediction.ipynb`.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to see the flow prediction results.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome. To contribute:

1. Fork the project.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
